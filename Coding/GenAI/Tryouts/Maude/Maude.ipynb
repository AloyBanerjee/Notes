       "'### 1. Hazard\\n- Battery Depletion\\n- Over-Infusion\\n- Failure to Charge\\n- Low Battery\\n- Premature Battery Depletion\\n- Battery Issue\\n- Circuit Failure\\n\\n### 2. Hazardous Situation\\n\\n- **Battery Depletion:** An insulin pump exhibited power system errors, with the user experiencing persistent errors for three days. Though the pump continued to function, analysis revealed a battery issue stemming from connector resistance on the electrical board, causing premature battery depletion.\\n\\n- **Over-Infusion:** An insulin pump and its reservoir experienced an over-delivery of insulin. No medical intervention was required, however, the device was not returned for analysis, leaving the cause undetermined.\\n\\n- **Failure to Charge:** A device exhibited battery performance issues, resulting in a clinician receiving a battery performance alert. The device was explanted and replaced. Further analysis showed the capacitor exceeded the charged time and the issue was caused by premature battery depletion due to lithium cluster formation.\\n\\n-  **Low Battery:** An insulin pump displayed a low battery and a blank screen. The device could not be turned on, and was missing its battery cap contact and had a worn serial number label.\\n\\n- **Premature Battery Depletion:** A device experienced premature battery depletion. Analysis confirmed lithium cluster formation as the cause, which is a known issue for these devices and was previously associated with a field action.\\n\\n-   **Battery Issue:** An IPG was explanted and replaced due to a battery issue. The patient was reported to be in stable condition.\\n\\n-  **Circuit Failure:** An insulin pump generated multiple error alarms. The user could clear the alarms but found that the battery cap metal connector was loose. Self-tests failed and a cold solder joint was found on the keypad assembly.\\n\\n### 3. Harm/Potential Harm\\n\\n-   **Battery Depletion:** The potential harm is that the device may malfunction due to the battery issue, leading to incorrect therapy delivery, including under or over-infusion in the case of insulin pumps. This can cause serious health complications such as hypo or hyperglycemia, seizures, coma, and potentially death. If the battery fails completely, therapy is interrupted and can lead to significant adverse health outcomes.\\n\\n-   **Over-Infusion:** The potential harm from over-infusion is the delivery of too much insulin leading to hypoglycemia. This can cause severe health complications such as seizures, coma, and potentially death. Over-infusion can also result in long-term health issues like nerve damage or organ failure.\\n\\n-   **Failure to Charge:** Failure to charge or premature battery depletion can lead to a device malfunction and cessation of therapy delivery resulting in incorrect therapy delivery. This can cause serious health complications, including pain, numbness, or paralysis, and can lead to permanent damage or death.\\n\\n-   **Low Battery:** A low battery and blank display can render the insulin pump unusable, leading to incorrect insulin delivery. This can result in serious health complications, including hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which in turn can lead to seizures, coma, or even death. The inability to operate the device and administer necessary insulin can have immediate and severe health consequences.\\n\\n-   **Premature Battery Depletion:** Premature battery depletion can lead to a device malfunction causing the device to not operate correctly or cause a cessation of therapy. This can cause serious health complications, including pain, numbness, or paralysis, and can lead to permanent damage or death.\\n\\n-   **Battery Issue:** A battery issue can lead to a device malfunction and cessation of therapy delivery which would cause incorrect therapy delivery. This can cause serious health complications, including pain, numbness, or paralysis, and can lead to permanent damage or death.\\n\\n-   **Circuit Failure:** Circuit failure can lead to device malfunctions and errors in therapy delivery. This can cause serious health complications such as hypo or hyperglycemia, seizures, coma, and potentially death. The inability to operate the device and administer necessary therapy can have immediate and severe health consequences.\\n\\n### 4.
