THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020. PRIOR TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE, THE QUALITY DOCUMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THIS ICD WERE RE-INVESTIGATED. ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ICD IS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION, BIO-LQC, INITIATED IN MARCH 2021. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020.

ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ICD IS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION, BIO-LQC, INITIATED IN MARCH 2021. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020.

ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ICD IS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION, BIO-LQC, INITIATED IN MARCH 2021. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ICD IS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION, BIO-LQC, INITIATED IN MARCH 2021. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ICD IS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION, BIO-LQC, INITIATED IN MARCH 2021. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2020.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.

THE DEVICE INTERROGATION REVEALED THE EOS BATTERY STATUS, DETECTED AFTER EXPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE ON (B)(6) 2020. THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 73 MONTHS AND 31 CHARGING CYCLES WERE RECORDED IN THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE ICD WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS. THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ICD WAS FOUND TO BE NORMAL AND AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY VOLTAGE WAS NOTED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FURTHER INSIGHTS, THE ICD WAS OPENED AND THE INNER ASSEMBLY WAS INSPECTED. THE VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ANOMALIES. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE WAS VERIFIED BY DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND PROVED TO BE AS EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERROGATED ICD DATA. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC MODULE. THEREFORE, THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE ELECTRONIC MODULE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE BATTERY LITHIUM PLATING WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO AN ELEVATED INTERNAL SELF-DEPLETION AND, AS A RESULT, TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION.
